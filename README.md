# Unity-LUN-Reporter

## Summary
Runs a report on a machine(s) with Unity LUN on it. The report is generated in
an HTML file and includes tables of the LUN name, the storage pool, and
percentages for the extreme performance, the performance, and the capacity.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
It is important to keep a log of how the LUNs are doing, so running reports
like these help to ensure the LUNs are running normally.

## Requirements
- PowerShell >= v3

## Usage
- Edit the config.ini file in case there are more machines to access. You can
  add more login credentials and IP addresses if needed.

- Simply run the script using a PowerShell terminal:
  `./Unity-LUN-Reporter.ps1`

## Compatibility
This is only tested on Windows and most likely will only work on Windows. It
should be possible to support PowerShell Core on Linux with only minor
adjustments so leave a feature request if there is any interest in that.
